#Notes from Class 05

Semantics vs. Style
Semantic - using HTML tags that have meaning

1. header
  a. nav menu a
  b. nav menu b
  c. nav menu c

2. main content
  a.
  b.

3 big grouping contents --> 1. Header, 2. Main, 3. Footer




Javascript normally uses IDs
Classes are normally for CSS

Cascading..
  from broad to narrow


Color
Font




Fieldset - grouping of form elements
  - comes with a natural builder
  - if there is a legend tag, you get a blurb of text on the border

Span - can control things within a <p> tag. Can go anywhere to wrap some snippet of content and target just that to apply JS/css





ARRAYS!!!!
we've been doing...

for (var i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

methods for arrays

var arr = Array() -> empty array
var arr = Array(10) -> array with 10 empty elements

arr.push(4) - adds to end
arr.pop() -> removes and returns last item of array
arr.shift() -> removed and returns first item in array

arr.indexOf('whatever') -> will return index of item in array. -1 means not in array
arr.includes() -> boolean answer to whether something is in an array

arr.splice(a, b) -> remove from array items at indices a and b, inclusive



Color
  rgb, rgba
  hsl

.className


in console,  click on styles and the individual color of the picker or the 1px whatever, you can control with arrows
